This is a simple gallery app that allows the user to search for images on flickr. 24 images will be displayed matching the search term.

You will need an api key to use this app. Store this key in a config.js file inside the src folder.

config.js will look like this:

const key = "thisIsMyApiKey1598938620";
export default key;

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
